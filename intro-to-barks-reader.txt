[b]Introduction to The Compleat Barks Disney Reader[/b]

Welcome to [i]The Compleat Barks Disney Reader,[/i] a comprehensive app
designed for Barks fans who have the digital version of [b][i]Fantagraphics
Complete Carl Barks Disney Library.[/i][/b] Built from the ground up with knowledge
of the Fantagraphics collection, this reader offers a unique and enhanced way to
read all of Carl Barks' Disney stories.

The idea for this reader started when I learnt the Fantagraphics library was available
in a digital version. Here was an uncensored (early on at least) library that I could
pull apart and reassemble in chronological order and read on a 16 inch laptop. That 
was the answer to one of my teenage-hood dreams - a proper uncut version of the complete
Barks canon presented chronologically in a quality way. To cut a long story short, I developed software
that knew all about Barks and the Fantagraphics library and could create standalone
(and digitally enhanced) versions of all his stories. But generic comic book readers didn't
know anything abut Barks so the final step was to create a Barks Reader app that would help the user 
explore and enjoy the stories in the best way possible.  

One of the most important features of this reader is a dedication to presenting
Barks' work as authentically as possible. Censorship omissions and alterations that
appeared in the Fantagraphics volumes have all been fixed. (Importantly, including a
restored version of [i]"Silent Night"[/i] colored in the flat Fantagraphics style.
And a restored version of the missing page from WDCS #74.) Dialogue changes have been
restored, allowing you to enjoy the comics in their original, unaltered form.
Possibly controversially, I've also restored the intent of three of his stories to what
Barks originally wanted: [i]Harpies[/i] instead of [i]Larkies[/i] in [i]The Golden Fleecing[/i], 
[i]Dere[/i] instead of [i]Theah[/i] in [i]Lost in the Andes![/i], and blank eyeballs for
Bombie in [i]Voodoo Hoodoo[/i]. If you disagree with any of my changes, there are options to turn them off.
And finally, you can navigate through the collection in chronological order based on Barks'
story submission dates.

Navigating the library easily was an important consideration and hopefully you will see that
in the table of contents. You can explore the entire collection in chronological order, 
following how Barks artistry developed over his long career. Or you can navigate by series or
by tagged categories (characters, places, etc.) 
Alternatively, there are search functions to find stories by title or
by descriptive tags. 

The app includes a built-in comic book reader that works 
directly with your own collection of Fantagraphics .zip or .cbz files. When you open
a story, the reader intelligently centers the pages and renumbers them according
to their original publication numbering, and in full page mode, allows for a
quality reading experience.
To enhance usability, the reader automatically remembers your
last position in the table of contents, so you can pick up where you left off
the next time you launch the app.

Visually, I've tried to make the application a tribute to Barks' artistry, using comic
book panels liberally as backgrounds throughout the interface, hopefully creating a fun and
nostalgic atmosphere.
