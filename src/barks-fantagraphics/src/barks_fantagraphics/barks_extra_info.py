    " There is in the Disney Archives an undated note to Barks from the"
    ' Disney studio, signed "Dorothy" (probably Dorothy Strebe, who worked in the Disney'
    ' publications department for more than twenty years), that reads in part as follows: [i]"Here'
    " is a 10-page story for Donald Duck. Hope that you like it ... you are to stage it, of course"

    "\n\nFrom a letter from Barks to Michael Barrier:"
    '[i]"They sent me a ready-written script to draw for story #1 several weeks after I left the'
    " studio... The script was the Crow story [WDCS 31]. I noticed some bad errors in the plot, and"
    " wrote the editor for permission to change things around. The result was they invited me to"
    " see if I could do a whole original story myself. The story of the kids and their"
    " 'rabbit foot' was my answer to the opportunity.\"[/i]",
    Titles.TOO_MANY_PETS: "In a June 9, 1968 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks wrote:"
    " [i]\"In the Sept. 1943 D.D. the story 'Too Many Pets' was a sort of collaboration. The script"
    " was started by a writer at the Disney Studio who found himself so overloaded with work on"
    " plots for the Mickey comic strips that he had to quit 'Too Many Pets.' I was handed the"
    " half-outlined plot and asked to do what I could with it. I merely polished up the other"
    " writer's gags and situations, and lengthened the tale, and lo! it didn't look too bad for"
    ' that spy-conscious era."[/i]'
    # " The Disney writer was named Merrill (something-or-other). He had"
    # " been Walt Kelly's partner in a story unit at Disneys. I understand he got fed up with gag"

    "[i]\"I'd been struggling for days trying to think of something"
    " that I could use for a long story plot ... I just sat by myself out on the lawn in the"
    " swing ... And all of a sudden I got to thinking of the Everglades, and what could Donald"
    " do in the Everglades, and what sort of creatures besides alligators would he find out in"
    " the Everglades, and just like that comes the thought of all these weird little people,"
    " like little gnomes that lived out in there. And as soon as I thought of them, my ideas"
    " of how to use them just kept popping into my head. So I just sat there and let the"
    " thoughts just pour all over me ... When I had gotten enough that I knew I had a story,"

    " up in jail. Western couldn't have a Disney character looking out from behind bars in the"
    " final panel of the story, so they changed the ending. They didn't usually redraw my art"
    " like that; the editors would often suggest that the artist do the changing himself. But"
    " these two panels would have been done by one of the staff artists, either Carl Buettner"
    ' or Tom McKimson."[/i]\n'

    'Barks commented: [i]"I can remember the first idea I had on that was just trying to figure'
    " out something Donald could do. I thought of him sailing boats and came up with a"
    " potential ten pages of gathering seaweed, and selling this kelp, which would give me"
    " a lot of gags with boats. I think of a scene, a locale, and think, 'Well,"
    " I feel in the mood to draw boats, and the ocean, and so on,' and that would"
    " cause me to start working on that particular type of story. As I developed more"
    " and more things with the story, I think it's quite possible that that 'Ghost of"
    " the Grotto' was brought in as a menace. There is so much in that, I couldn't have"
    " thought of it in a whole bucketful of writing at once. It had to come out one thing"
    ' after another."[/i]',
    Titles.CHRISTMAS_ON_BEAR_MOUNTAIN: "The first appearance of [b][i]Uncle Scrooge.[/i][/b]"
    " In the [i]Duck Man[/i] interview Barks said: "
    '[i]"The office, I think, wanted me to do a Christmas story, and so I cast around for'
    " Christmas stories. I began to think of the great Dickens Christmas story about Scrooge;"
    " it is the classic of all Christmas stories. I just was thief enough to sort of steal some"
    " of the idea and have a rich uncle for Donald. And all these situations of the bear and"
    " Donald having to go to this cabin in the wintertime to prove his bravery and so on."
    ' It just came out of the situation of bringing in a rich uncle."[/i]',
    Titles.GOLDEN_CHRISTMAS_TREE_THE: "In a letter to a fan dated March 22, 1961, Barks mentions"
    ' "The Golden Christmas Tree." [i]"I felt surly about the finished story because the editors'
    " had made me do some changes in the fight sequence between Don and the witch that I thought"
    " took the guts out of the story. I still gag when I read the last two pages of the story."
    ' But the rest of the tale was robust enough."[/i] In a more recent letter (October 3, 1973),'
    " Barks says, [i]\"About the last two pages of 'The Golden Christmas Tree'-only the last"
    " four panels are mine as they were in the original. I still wince at the preachy stuff I"
    " had to put in about the 'spirit of Christmas.'[/i]",
    Titles.SHERIFF_OF_BULLET_VALLEY: "Barks caricatured himself on a wanted poster on the last"
    ' page of this story. He said in the 1971 interview: [i]"That caricature originated in'
    " the old Disney studio's story gag-fests where the guys used to draw of each other and"
    " circulate around. Some of the guys took to drawing me with this tremendous big schnoz,"
    ' so I just copied that old caricature."[/i]',
    Titles.LOST_IN_THE_ANDES: 'In a 1962 interview, Barks agreed that [i]"my best story,'
    ' technically, is probably the square egg one."[/i]\n\n'
    "From 'www.seriesam.com:' [i]\"Western Publishing objected to the accent Barks had given the"
    " Plain Awful people and so they (for example) replaced incorrect use of 'd' with 'th'"
    ' in their dialogue."[/i] Accordingly, in this digital edition, the Southern accents have been'
    " restored to what Barks originally intended, using [i]Dis, Dat, Dey, D', De,[/i] and"

    " In the [i]Duck Man[/i] interview Barks said this about Gladstone:"
    ' [i]"Well, I think the reason for bringing in Gladstone was that I thought of this'
    " situation of Donald having to take a midwinter swim in a lake of ice-cold water."
    " It was something, I guess, from reading of the Polar Bear Club up in San Francisco"
    " that go out under the Golden Gate and swim around on New Year's Day."
    " And I just thought of Donald: how in the summertime he would get very rash and boast"
    " that he would go into the water in the wintertime. And so that's how Gladstone got into it."
    '" He had to be somebody that Donald was trying to outdo.[/i]"',

    " digital edition: [i]\"Fantagraphics'"
    " plan for their Donald V1 [Fantagraphics CBDL 1] was to use a newly recovered all-Barks"
    ' version of the "South Seas" story, because I had a lead on where original line art'
    " photostats could be found... Alas, I [b]couldn't[b] acquire the original version by press"
    " time—so my 2006 partial restoration (from Gemstone's WALT DISNEY TREASURES Vol 1) was used"
    " in Donald V1 instead. It's actually a mix of Barks and Jippes..."
    ' and I\'m still attempting to recover the all-Barks version of "South Seas." Presuming'

    ' luck: [i]"Well, that came the second time I was using him [actually, the second time'
    " in a long Donald story]. I established him as an obnoxious character in"
    " his first story, and so the second time I used him, I thought of what particular"
    " thing can make that guy [i]lastingly[/i] obnoxious. And so I thought of this lucky angle."
    ' He was the kind of guy who who got all the breaks, and poor old Donald never got anywhere."',
    Titles.IN_ANCIENT_PERSIA: 'From a June 9, 1968 letter to Michael Barrier: [i]"About my'
    " 'morgue' of reference material. I have four filing bins of clippings of every sort of"

    " his use of humans in [i]Dangerous Disguise:[/i]"
    " [i]\"Well, that was a situation which I somehow couldn't visualize all these"
    " master spies from all the different nations as being dog-faces or pig-faces;"
    " I visualized them as looking like they do in the movies: these suave-looking"
    " characters and the beautiful girl spies. They—to me, somehow—they just had"
    " to look like human beings; I couldn't—just couldn't—see them any other way."

    " From the [i]Duck Man[/i] interview:"
    ' "I think that every cartoonist that ever ran anything in comic strips and newspapers'
    " always had a crazy inventor at some time in their strips. So I was in need of a crazy"
    " inventor, so I just deliberately invented Gyro as a crazy inventor, but I had only"
    " figured on using him once in a great while. So I just made him a big, awkward-looking"
    " chicken. If I'd known I was going to have to do a book of Gyro stories and so on,"
    " I would have made him about the same size as Donald and Uncle Scrooge so that he could"

    " playing with money:"

    " thing for him – to play with his money, physically play with it. And those were things"

    " up a few dollars and you touch them, they're hard; they don't yield or bounce around like"

    " about how it happened: \n"

    " office during the war, doing drafting of these big bombers and so on, so she had gotten"
    " to have a wonderful lettering style. Garé started doing lettering and inking in all the"
    " background details in about October of 1952. She'd ink in all those things. And she would"
    " put in the solid blacks in the ducks' jackets, and the eyeballs, and so on. She kept doing"
    " more and more of it, and I was paying her more and more, and finally we decided, hell,"
    " what's the use of going on like this? We might as well get married and pool the money all"
    ' in one bundle."[/i]',
    Titles.WORM_WEARY: 'Garé Barks said this about inking the story: [i]"For quite a while I just'
    " did some of the blacking. I remember one of the first stories I worked on was a Gyro"
    " Gearloose in which he caught some mammoth fish. Carl left all the scales for me to put on! I"
    " was so nervous because I'd never done anything that thousands and thousands of people would"

    ' on the ending to [i]"The Money Stairs": "...it was quite likely changed to a dream ending'
